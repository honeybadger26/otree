        In this task, you have been randomly matched with two unique individuals (no one else has been matched with
        either of these people) Participant A and Participant B. You, Participant A and Participant B will remain
        mutually anonymous.
    </p>

    <p>
        Participant A and Participant B are not present at the moment. We will invite them to a venue on campus next
        week. We will explain to all these participants the procedure for the experiment you are doing now, so they
        understand the choices you made, and how their payment was determined.
    </p>
    <p>
        You need to make a decision about how to allocate some money between yourself and the
        other participants. The money has been initially allocated so that you receive $10,
        Participant A receives $10 and Participant B receives $0. You need to choose between two
        options (pictured below).
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Option 1:</b> You keep the current allocations: you receive $10, Participant A received $10
            and Participant B receives $0.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Option 2:</b> You can elect to take an extra $2 for yourself, in which case Participant A's allocation
            will be reduced to $0 and Participant B will receive $2. So, you will receive $12, Participant A will
            receive $0 and Participant B will receive $2.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <table cellpadding="10">
        <tr>
