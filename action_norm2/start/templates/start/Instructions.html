    <p>
        Thank you for coming. You have earned $10 for showing up on time. The following
        instructions explain how you can earn additional money by participating in the
        experiment. It is therefore very important that you read these instructions carefully
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Please do not communicate with the other participants during the experiment.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have a question at any time, please raise your hand and the monitor will come to
        your desk to answer it. When you ask a question, please make sure to speak softly so as
        not to disturb the other participants.
    </p>

        Today ºs experiment involves a number of tasks. In each task, you will be endowed with a
        number of points called ECU (experimental currency units). Each ECU is worth 5 cents.
        At the end of each task, we will explain how many ECU you earned in that task. At the
        end of the overall experiment, we will randomly select one task to be paid. So your final
        payment today will be $10 for showing up, plus whatever you earned in one of the tasks,
        chosen at random
    </p>
