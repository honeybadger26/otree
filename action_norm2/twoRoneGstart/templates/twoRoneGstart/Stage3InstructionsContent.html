            Stage 3: Deduction points
        </h3>

        <p>
            In stage 3, the <b>two participants who did not get an opportunity to press either type
            of button</b> have the option of supporting a policy of deducting points from participants
            who behaved in particular ways at Stages 1 and 2
        </p>
        <p>
            One of these participants will be the person who had 120 ECU deducted when the red
            buttons were pressed (and restored again if the green button was pressed). The other
            participant will have been unaffected by the earlier stages. We will refer to these
            participants as the <i>button-affected participant</i> and the <i>unaffected participant</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Deduction points will be determined each round on the basis of a collective decision.
        </p>
        <p>
            The unaffected participant will be asked two questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                How many deduction points do you wish to assign to the red button presser?
            </li>
            <li>
                How many deduction points do you wish to assign to each green button non-presser
                (if there was one)?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The button-affected participant will then be asked whether he/she agrees to the other
            participantʼs proposal. If the button-affected participant agrees, the proposal will be
            enacted.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Assigning</i> a deduction point to an individual costs 1 ECU, and this cost is shared equally
            between both the button-affected participant and the unaffected participant.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each deduction point <i>assigned</i> to an individual will have the effect of reducing that
            individualʼs endowment by 3 ECU.
        </p>
        <p>
            The maximum number of deduction points that can be assigned, in total, on each round,
            is 30.
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, continuing the example above, the two participants who have the
            opportunity to support a deduction policy are A and B, because C and E had the
            opportunity to press the red button, and D had the opportunity to press the green
            button. Suppose C and E have both pressed the red button, and D has refused to press
            the green button, then the endowments will be:
        </p>
        <table cellpadding="10" border="1">
            <tr>
                <th>A</th>
                <th>B</th>
                <th>C</th>
                <th>D</th>
                <th>E</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>80</td>
                <td>200</td>
                <td>240</td>
                <td>240</td>
                <td>240</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        </br>
        <p>
            Imagine B proposes that 6 deduction points be assigned to each red presser, and 10
            points assigned to the green non-presser. If A agrees to this proposal, then this policy
            will cost A and B a total of (6 x 2) + 10 = 22 ECU. This cost is shared between A and B,
            so will cost them 11 ECU each.
        </p>
        <p>
            This policy will have the effect of reducing the earnings of C and E by 18 ECU each, and
            the earnings of D by 30 ECU. So the final outcome will be:
        </p>
        <table cellpadding="10" border="1">
            <tr>
                <th>A</th>
                <th>B</th>
                <th>C</th>
                <th>D</th>
                <th>E</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>69</td>
                <td>69</td>
                <td>222</td>
                <td>210</td>
                <td>222</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        </br>
        <p>
            If A rejected Bʼs proposal, then no deduction would occur, and the endowments would be
            unchanged.
