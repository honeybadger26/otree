    <p>
        You are in a group of five people. You will be in the same group for 20 rounds. Each
        round, you will be randomly assigned a new identifier (A, B, C, D, E), so you won ºt be able
        to tell who is whom from round to round.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each round, everyone is endowed with 200 ECU (economic currency units).
    </p>
    <p>
        What you do during the round will affect your endowment on that round.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your earnings for this task will be the outcome of one round, chosen at random. So every
        round may be the one that determines your final earnings for this task.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each Round has a number of stages.
    </p>
