        <h3>Task 1 - Instructions</h3>
        <p>
            In this task, you have been randomly matched with two unique individuals (no one else has
            been matched with either of these people) Participant A and Participant B. You, Participant
            A and Participant B will remain mutually anonymous.
        </p>
        <p>
            Participant A and Participant B are not present at the moment. We will invite them to a
            venue on campus next week. We will explain to all these participants the procedure for the
            experiment you are doing now, so they understand the choices you made, and how their
            payment was determined. It is very important to us that you realise that the decision you
            make has real consequences for yourself, Participant A and Participant B.
        </p>
        <p>
            You need to make a decision about how to allocate some money between yourself and the
            other participants. The money has been initially allocated so that you receive $10,
            Participant A receives $10 and Participant B receives $0. You need to choose between
            three options (pictured below).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Option 1:</b> You keep the current allocations: you receive $10, Participant A receives $10 and
                Participant B receives $0
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Option 2:</b> You can elect to take an extra $2 for yourself, in which case Participant A’s
                allocation will be reduced to $0 and Participant B will receive $2. So, you will receive $12,
                Participant A will receive $0 and Participant B will receive $2.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Option 3:</b> You can elect to take an extra $3 for yourself, in which case Participant A’s
                allocation will be reduced to $3 and Participant B will receive $0. So, you will receive $13,
                Participant A will receive $3, and Participant B will receive $0.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Note: Based on your choice, we will contact either Participant A or Participant B to be paid
            next week. If you choose either Option 1 or Option 3, then Participant B will not be
            invited to be paid, and will have no knowledge about the experiment. If you choose Option
            2, then Participant A will not be invited to be paid, and will have no knowledge about the
            experiment.
