        <h3>Task 2a - Instructions</h3>
        <p>
            In this section there are three sub-tasks (2a, 2b, 2c). Each sub-task is independent of the
            others, meaning your decisions in each subtask will not affect your earnings in previous
            subtasks, or future subtasks. At the end of the experiment <b>only one of these three subtasks</b>
            will be randomly chosen for payment. All tasks are equally likely to be chosen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that each subtask could be the selected one that will be implemented for payment. So,
            it is in your interest to treat each subtask as if it could be the one that determines your
            payment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your earnings from the experiment will be your earnings from task 1 + the earnings from the
            randomly selected subtask in this section of the experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this task you have been randomly matched with a <b>different</b> unique individual. In other
            words, this is not the same individual you were matched with in Task 1. You will be matched
            with this same individual for these next three decision subtasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once again, the participant you have been randomly matched with is not present at the
            moment. We will invite them to a venue on campus next week to be paid. We will explain to
            these participants the procedure for the relevant subtask, so they understand
            the choices you made, and how their payment was determined.
        </p>
        <p>
            (The participant you have been matched with will not know about your decisions in the
            other two subtasks, that are not selected for payment.)
        </p>
        <p>
            This first subtask involves an element of chance (see the picture below). With a 50% probability
            you will be assigned to version 1. With a 50% probability you will be assigned to version 2.
            Notice that both possible versions of this subtask are the same, except that two of the other
            participantâ€™s payments have been switched. Note that in both versions, you get your highest
            payment of $12 by choosing option 2. in the version on the left, this gives the other
            participant his or her lowest payment of $2. In the version on the right this gives the other
            participant his or her highest payment of $10. In both versions, if you choose option 1, you
            will receive the lower payment of $10. In the version on the left, this gives the other
            participant his or her highest payment of $10. In the version on the right, this gives the
            other participant his or her lowest payment of $2.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that you will not know which of the versions you have been assigned, but your own
            payment will be identical. The only thing that differs are the payments for the other
            participant.
        </p>
        <p>
            Which of these versions will you actually be assigned? That was determined randomly by
            the computer at the beginning of the experiment, with each version being equally likely.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will never reveal publicly which version you are actually assigned, however, you can
            choose to find out by clicking a "Reveal" button. This choice will be private. The other
            participant will not know if you have clicked the Reveal button. However, you are not
            required to find out and may choose not to click the Reveal button.
