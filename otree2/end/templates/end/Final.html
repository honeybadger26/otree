{% block content %}

    <p>
        Tasks {{ chosen_task1 }} and {{ chosen_task2 }} will be paid. Your
        earnings are therefore {{ payoff1 }} + {{ payoff2 }} + {{ part_fee }}
        show-up fee = {{ total }}.
    </p>

    {% if chosen_task1 == 3 or chosen_task2 == 3 %}
        <p>
            In order to collect your payment for Task 3, you <b>must sign a print-out
            of the relevant statement</b>. Please wait at your desk while we print out
            each participantâ€™s statement to be signed.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you change your mind, and do not wish to sign the list of statements,
            that is acceptable. Simply let us know when you are called up to be paid,
            and your final payment will be {{ total_no3 }}
        </p>
        <p>
            In the meantime, please collect all the items on your desk, and wait for
            your desk number to be called. You may use your phone quietly while you wait.
        </p>
