<div>
  {{ if results.chose_to_take }}
    <p>
      A decided to take {{ Constants.take_amount }} ECU from
      {{ results.deducting_player }}.
    </p>
  {{ else }}
      <p>A decided not to take {{ Constants.take_amount }} ECU from
      {{ results.deducting_player }}.</p>
  {{ endif }}

  <p>This led to the following distribution of endowments:</p>

  <table class="simple-table">
    <tr>
      {{ for player_role, payoff in results.payoffs_after_take.items }}
        <th>{{ player_role }}</th>
      {{ endfor }}
    </tr>
    <tr>
      {{ for player_role, payoff in results.payoffs_after_take.items }}
        <td>{{ payoff }}</td>
      {{ endfor }}
    </tr>
  </table>
  

  {{ if results.chose_to_take }}
    <p>
      {{ results.deducting_player }} chose to spend
      {{ results.deduct_amount }} ECU on deductions. This had the effect of
      reducing A's endowment by {{ results.amount_reduced }} ECU, and
      reducing {{ results.deducting_player }}'s endowment by
      {{ results.deduct_amount }} ECU.
    </p>
	
 {{ else }}
     <p>Note that <strong>if A had chosen to take</strong>,  {{ results.deducting_player }} 
  	   would have spent {{ results.deduct_amount }} ECU on deductions.</p>
	   
	   <p>This would have reduced A's endowment by {{ results.amount_reduced }} ECU.</p>
  {{ endif }}

  <p>Final earnings for this task are:</p>

  <table class="simple-table">
    <tr>
      {{ for player_role, payoff in results.final_payoffs.items }}
        <th>{{ player_role }}</th>
      {{ endfor }}
    </tr>
    <tr>
      {{ for player_role, payoff in results.final_payoffs.items }}
        <td>{{ payoff }}</td>
      {{ endfor }}
    </tr>
  </table>
