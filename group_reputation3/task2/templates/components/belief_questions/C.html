    While you are waiting for A and B to finish their decisions in Task 1,
    please answer the following questions.
  </p>
  <p>
    For some of these questions, we will be asking you to guess how other
    people behaved or answered in today's experiment. We will choose one of
    these questions at random, and compare your answer to people's actual
    behavior. If your guess is correct, you will earn an additional
    {{ Constants.additional_amount }} ECU for this task.

        <p>
          In today's lab session, there is at least one other group where
          participants B and C are {{ same_group_sort }}. Considering the
          other groups that are {{ same_group_sort }}, but excluding your own
          group, what do you think is the most frequently chosen amount of
          deduction by participant B?
        </p>

        {{ with field_control=form.ee_c_group }}
          {{ with field_name="ee_c_group" }}
            <p>
              I think B's who are {{ same_group_sort }} will most frequently
              choose to spend 
              {{ include "components/ECUFieldInput.html" }}
              ECU on deductions from A.

            I think B's in today's lab session will most frequently choose to
            spend

        Please tell us how many ECU you think B <b>should</b> deduct from A?
        In other words, what do you think is the <b>socially appropriate</b>
        amount of ECU for B to deduct?

          Considering all the groups where B and C are {{ same_group_sort }},

          given answer to the last question?

          {{ with field_name="ne_c_c_group" }}
            <p>
              I think the most common answer from C's who are
              {{ same_group_sort }} will be that B should spend
              {{ include "components/ECUFieldInput.html" }}
              ECU on deductions from A.

            I think the most common answer from C's in today's session will be
            that B should spend

            ECU on deductions from A.
