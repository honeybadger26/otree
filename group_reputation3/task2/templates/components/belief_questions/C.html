        In today's lab session, there is at least one other group where
        participants B and C are {{ same_group_sort }}. Considering the
        other groups that are {{ same_group_sort }}, but excluding your own
        group, what do you think is the most frequently chosen amount of
        deduction by participant B?

        <br>

        {{ with field_control=form.ee_c_group }}
          {{ with field_name="ee_c_group" }}
            I think B's who are {{ same_group_sort }} will most frequently
            choose to spend 
            {{ include "components/ECUFieldInput.html" }}
            ECU on deductions from A.
            {{ include "components/ECUFieldButton.html" }}

      Please tell us how many ECU you think B <b>should</b> deduct from A?
      In other words, what do you think is the <b>socially appropriate</b>
      amount of ECU for B to deduct?

      {{ with field_control=form.ne_c }}
        {{ with field_name="ne_c" }}
          I think B should spend

        Considering all the groups where B and C are {{ same_group_sort }},
        but excluding your own group, what do you think is the most commonly
        given answer to the last question?

        <br>

        {{ with field_control=form.ne_c_c_group }}
          {{ with field_name="ne_c_c_group" }}
            I think the most common answer from C's who are
            {{ same_group_sort }} will be that B should spend
            {{ include "components/ECUFieldInput.html" }}
            ECU on deductions from A.
