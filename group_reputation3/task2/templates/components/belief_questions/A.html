  <p>Please answer the following questions.</p>
  <p>
    For some of these questions, we will be asking you to guess how other
    people behaved or answered in today's experiment. We will choose one of
    these questions at random, and compare your answer to people's actual
    behavior. If your guess is correct, you will earn an additional
    {{ Constants.additional_amount }} ECU for this task.

          In today's lab session, there is at least one other group where
          participants B and C are {{ same_group_sort }}. Considering the other
          groups that are {{ same_group_sort }}, but excluding your own group,
          what do you think is the most frequently chosen amount of deduction
          by participant B?
