            The unaffected participant has proposed to assign {{ red_d_pts }} deduction points to red button
            pressers and {{ green_d_pts }} to any green button non-pressers. This proposal, if accepted by you, will
            cost each of you {{ deduction_cost }} ECU and will have the effect of reducing the red
            button presserʼs earnings by {{ red_d_pts_multiplied }} ECU and the green button non-pressersʼ earnings by
            {{ green_d_pts_multiplied }} ECU.
