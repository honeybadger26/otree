            Stage 3: Deduction points
        </h3>

        <p>
            In stage 3, the <b>two participants who did not get an opportunity to press either type
            of button</b> have the option of supporting a policy of deducting points from participants
            who behaved in particular ways at Stages 1 and 2.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of these participants will be the person who had 120 ECU deducted when the red
            buttons were pressed (and restored again if the green button was pressed). The other
            participant will have been unaffected by the earlier stages. We will refer to these
            participants as the <i>button-affected participant</i> and the <i>unaffected participant</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Deduction points will be determined each round on the basis of a collective decision.
        </p>
        <p>
            The unaffected participant will be asked two questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                How many deduction points do you wish to assign to each red button presser?
            </li>
            <li>
                How many deduction points do you wish to assign to the green button non-presser
                (if there was one)?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The button-affected participant will then be asked whether he/she agrees to the other
            participantʼs proposal. If the button-affected participant agrees, the proposal will be
            enacted.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Assigning</i> a deduction point to an individual costs 1 ECU, and this cost is shared equally
            between both the button-affected participant and the unaffected participant. That is, it will cost
            each of these participants 0.5 ECU.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each deduction point <i>assigned</i> to an individual will have the effect of reducing that
            individualʼs endowment by 3 ECU.
        </p>
        <p>
            The maximum number of deduction points that can be assigned to each person is 10.
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, continuing the example above, the two participants who have the
            opportunity to support a deduction policy are A and B. Suppose C and E have both
            pressed the red button, and D has refused to press the green button, then the effect on
            overall endowments of decisions so far will be:
        </p>
        <table cellpadding="10" border="1" style="text-align:center;">
            <tr>
                <th>A</th>
                <th>B</th>
                <th>C</th>
                <th>D</th>
                <th>E</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>-120</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>+20</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>+20</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        </br>
        <p>
            Imagine B proposes that 6 deduction points be assigned to each red presser, and 10
            points assigned to the green non-presser. If A agrees to this proposal, then this policy
            will cost A and B a total of (6 x 2) + 10 = 22 ECU. This cost is shared between A and B,
            so will cost them 11 ECU each.
        </p>
        <p>
            This policy will have the effect of reducing the earnings of C and E by 18 ECU each, and
            the earnings of D by 30 ECU. So the final outcome will be:
        </p>
        <table cellpadding="10" border="1" style="text-align:center;">
            <tr>
                <th>A</th>
                <th>B</th>
                <th>C</th>
                <th>D</th>
                <th>E</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>-120-11=-131</td>
                <td>-11</td>
                <td>+20-18=+2</td>
                <td>-30</td>
                <td>+20-18=+2</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        </br>
        <p>
            If A rejected Bʼs proposal, then no deduction would occur, and the endowments would be
            unchanged.
