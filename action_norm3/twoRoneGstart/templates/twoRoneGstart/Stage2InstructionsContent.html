            Stage 2: The green button
        </h3>

        <p>
            This stage arises when, on the previous stage, both red button participants pressed the
            red button. If both buttons were pressed, a third participant would have had their
            endowment reduced. If only one red button was pressed, this stage will be skipped, and
            you will proceed directly to stage 3.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this stage, one of the <b>other two participants</b> will be chosen at random to have the opportunity
            to press a green button.
        </p>
        <p>
            The green button does the “reverse” of the red button. If pressed, it will:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                reduce the endowment of whoever presses it by 40 ECU, and
            </li>
            <li>
                increase the endowment of whoever lost ECU in the previous stage by 120 ECU,
                returning them to their original endowment.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To illustrate, suppose that person D is the one chosen to have the opportunity to press
            the green button.
        </p>
        <p>
            If D does not press the button, then everyoneʼs earnings from the earlier stage will be
            unchanged. So the changes from initial endowments will be:
        </p>
        <table cellpadding="10" border="1" style="text-align:center;">
            <tr>
                <th>A</th>
                <th>B</th>
                <th>C</th>
                <th>D</th>
                <th>E</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>-120</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>+20</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>+20</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        </br>
        <p>
            If D does press the button, the overall effect will be:
        </p>
        <table cellpadding="10" border="1" style="text-align:center;">
            <tr>
                <th>A</th>
                <th>B</th>
                <th>C</th>
                <th>D</th>
                <th>E</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>+20</td>
                <td>-40</td>
                <td>+20</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        </br>
        <p>
            After the decision has been made whether or not to press the green button, participants
            enter the final stage of the round, Stage 3.
