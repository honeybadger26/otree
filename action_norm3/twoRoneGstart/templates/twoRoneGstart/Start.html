    <p>
        You are in a group of {{ Constants.players_per_group }} people. You will be in the same group for 12 rounds. Each
        round, you will be randomly assigned a new identifier (A, B, C, D, E), so you won ºt be able
        to tell who is whom from round to round.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each round, everyone is endowed with either 180, 200, or 220 ECU (economic currency units). It is randomly
        decided which of these three allocations you are endowed with.
    </p>
    <p>
        What you do during the round will affect your endowment on that round.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your earnings for this task will be the outcome of <i>one round</i>, chosen at random. So every
        round may be the one that determines your final earnings for this task.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each Round has a number of stages.
