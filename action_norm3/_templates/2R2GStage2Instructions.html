            Stage 2: The green buttons
        </h3>

        <p>
            This stage arises when, on the previous stage, both red button participants pressed the
            red button. If both buttons were pressed, a third participant would have had their
            endowment reduced. If only one red button was pressed, this stage will be skipped, and
            you will proceed directly to stage 3.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this stage, two of the <b>other three participants</b> will be chosen at random to have the opportunity
            to press a green button.
        </p>
        <p>
            The green buttons do the "reverse" of the red button. If one of the green buttons is
            pressed, it will:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                reduce the endowment of whoever presses it by {{ Constants.one_green_btn_loss }} ECU, and
            </li>
            <li>
                increase the endowment of whoever lost ECU in the previous stage by {{ Constants.one_green_btn_gain }} ECU,
                returning them to their original endowment.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If both of the green buttons are pressed, it will:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                reduce the endowment of each person who presses by {{ Constants.two_green_btn_loss }} ECU, and
            </li>
            <li>
                increase the endowment of whoever lost ECU in the previous stage by {{ Constants.two_green_btn_gain }} ECU,
                returning them to their original endowment.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To illustrate, suppose that persons D and F are the ones chosen to have the opportunity
            to press the green button.
        </p>
        <p>
            If both D and F do not press the button, then everyone's earnings from the earlier stage
            will be unchanged. So the changes from initial endowments will be:

            <tr>
                <th>A</th>

            If D does press the button, but F does not, the overall effect will be:

            If both D and F press their green buttons, the overall effect will be:

            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            After the decision has been made whether or not to press the green button, participants
            enter the final stage of the round, Stage 3.
