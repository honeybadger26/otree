        Earlier in this experiment, you participated in one task in which there were <b>two people</b>
        who had the opportunity to press a <b>red button</b> and <b>one person</b> who had the opportunity
        to press a <b>green button</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Imagine a scenario in which both <b>red buttons were pressed</b> by participants C and B, and the <b>green
        button was not pressed</b> by participant A. As a result, participant D - the button-affected participant
        - lost 120 ECU.

        Indicate agreement, with the following

    <ul>
        <li>
            Participant C's pressing Red was one of the causes of the button-affected participant losing 120 ECU.
