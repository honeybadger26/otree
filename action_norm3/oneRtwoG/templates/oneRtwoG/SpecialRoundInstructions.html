    <p>
        <strong>
            On this round, we will ask all of you to enter your hypothetical decision for stages 1,
            2, and 3, before you know whether or not you have been chosen to have the
            opportunity to press the red button, the green button, or to apply deduction points.
            We will take everyone ºs hypothetical decisions, and then randomly determine who
            has those roles, and use the information you have given us.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        So on this round you will receive the following questions:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>{{ Constants.sp_questions.sp_pressed_red }}</li>
        <li>{{ Constants.sp_questions.sp_pressed_green }}</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Stage 3 might occur in three different ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            (One red, no green) Only one red button might have been pressed, and neither
            green button may hdave been pressed. In this scenario, you may assign deduction
            points to all three individuals who had the opportunity to press a button
        </li>
        <li>
            (One red, one green) The red button may have been pressed, and only one green
            button may have been pressed. In this scenario, you can assign deduction points to
            the red button presser, and to the green button refuser.
        </li>
        <li>
            (One red, two green) The red button, and both green buttons may have been
            pressed. In this scenario, you may assign deduction points only to the red button
            presser.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We will ask you which deduction policy you would support, as the unaffected participant,
        for each of these three scenarios.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>{{ Constants.sp_questions.sp_unaff_0g }}</li>
        <li>{{ Constants.sp_questions.sp_unaff_1g }}</li>
        <li>{{ Constants.sp_questions.sp_unaff_2g }}</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We now ask you which policies you would agree to in these three scenarios, if you were
        the button-affected participant in earlier stages. For these questions, select every policy
        that you would agree to. You may choose more than one policy.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>{{ Constants.sp_questions.sp_aff_0g }}</li>
        <li>{{ Constants.sp_questions.sp_aff_1g }}</li>
        <li>{{ Constants.sp_questions.sp_aff_2g }}</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        After you have answered these questions, we will randomly choose participants to have
        the opportunity to press the red and green buttons, and who will be the button-affected
        individual. We will then use your answers to determine the outcome of the round. You will
        then receive feedback on the outcome.
    </p>
