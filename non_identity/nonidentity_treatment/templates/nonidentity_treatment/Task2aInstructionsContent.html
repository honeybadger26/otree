            Task 2 - Part A Instructions
        </h3>

        <p>
            In this section there are three sub-tasks (Part A, B and C). Each sub-task is independent of the others,
            meaning your decisions in each sub-task will not affect your earnings in previous sub-tasks, or future
            sub-tasks. At the end of the experiment <b>only one of these three sub-tasks</b> will be randomly chosen
            for payment. All tasks are equally likely to be chosen.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that each sub-task could be the selected one that will be implemented for payment. So, it is in
            your interest to treat each sub-tasks as if it could be the one that determines your payment.

        </p>

        <p>
            Your earnings from the experiment will be your earnings from Task 1 + the earnings from the randomly
            selected sub-task in this section of the experiment.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this task you have been randomly matched with a <b>different</b> unique individual. In other words,
            this is not the same individual you were matched with in Task 1. You will be matched with this same
            individual for these next three decision sub-tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once again, the participant you have been randomly matched with is not present at the moment. We will
            invite them to a venue on campus next week. We will explain to these participants the procedure for the
            experiment you are doing now, so they understand the choices you made, and how their payment was
            determined.
        </p>

        <p>
            The participant you have been matched with, will not know about your decisions in the two tasks that
            are not selected for payment in this section.
        </p>

        <p>
            This first task involves an element of chance (see the picture below). With a 50% probability you will
            be assigned to version 1. With a 50% probability you will be assigned to version 2. Notice that both
            possible versions of this task are the same, except that two of the other participantâ€™s payments have
            been switched. Note that in both versions, you get your highest payment of $12 by choosing option 2. in
            the version on the left, this gives the other participant his or her lowest payment of $2. In the version
            on the right this gives the other participant his or her highest payment of $10. In both versions, if
            you choose option 1, you will receive the lower payment of $10. In the version on the left, this gives
            the other participant the highest payment of $10. In the version on the right, this gives the other
            participant the lowest payment of $2.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that you will not know which of the versions you have been assigned, but your own payment will be
            identical. The only thing that differs are the payments for the other participant.
        </p>

        <p>
            Which of these versions will you actually be assigned? That was determined randomly by the computer at
            the beginning of the experiment, with each version being equally likely.
        </p>

        <p>
            We will never reveal publicly which version you are actually assigned, however, you can choose to find
            out by clicking a button. This choice will be private. The other participant will not know if you have
            clicked the button. However, you are not required to find out and may choose not to click the button.
