            In this task, you have been randomly matched with a unique individual (no one else has been matched with this
            person). You and this other participant will remain mutually anonymous.
        </p>

        <p>
            The participant you have been randomly matched with is not present at the moment. We will invite them to a
            venue on campus next week. We will explain to these participants the procedure for the experiment you are
            doing now, so they understand the choices you made, and how their payment was determined.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you wish to check on our procedure, you may come to the venue next week to observe the process and confirm
            that we make these payments as promised. It is very important to us that you realise that the decision you make
            has real consequences for yourself and for another participant.
        </p>

            You need to make a decision about how to allocate some money between yourself and the other participant. The
            money has been initially allocated so that both of you receive $10. You need to choose between two options
            (pictured below).
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Option 1</b>: You keep the current allocations: you receive $10, the other participant receives $10.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Option 2</b>: You can elect to take an extra $2 for yourself, in which case the other participantâ€™s allocation will
            be reduced to $2. So, you will receive $12, and they will receive $2.
        </p>

            <tr>
                <th>You Choose</th>
