    <p>
        You will now be presented with each of the statements you accepted in the 
        preceding part of this task.
    </p>
 
    <p>
        For each statement, you will be asked whether you are willing to accept the 
        opposite statement, in exchange for an amount of money between 
        ${{ Constants.min_bid}} and ${{ Constants.max_bid }}. 
    </p>

    <p>
        For example: If you are willing to accept the opposite statement for $35 or 
        more, but not for any lesser amount, you would enter $35.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you do not wish to change your statement for any amount in that range, 
        type "{{ Constants.opt_out_text }}".
    </p>

    <p>
        After all your bids are entered, we will select one of the 
        {{ Constants.statements|length }} pairs at random and generate a random 
        number between {{ Constants.min_bid}}-{{ Constants.max_bid }}.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the number generated is greater than or equal to your lowest acceptable 
        amount for that statement, we will pay you the randomly generated number 
        (in dollars) in exchange for changing your statement. 
    </p>

    <p>
        If the random number is less than your minimum amount, or if you opted out, 
        we will pay you nothing, and your statement will be unchanged.
    </p>

    <p>
        So for example: if we roll 33, and you nominated 30, we will pay you $33 to 
        accept the opposite statement. If we roll 24, the number will be below your 
        nominated price, so you will be paid nothing, and you wonâ€™t change which 
        statement you accept.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the end of the Task, we will ask you to sign a printed copy of the 
        statement you have accepted.
    </p>
