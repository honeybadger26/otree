    Task 3 - Instructions

{% block content %}

    <p>
        In this task, you will interact with one other person in the room, 
        chosen at random. The person you are interacting with is definitely 
        NOT the person you interacted with in the first task.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will have the same interaction as in Task 1 (instructions below), 
        and you will play the same role as you had last time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before the interaction occurs, there is one important difference: Participant 
        A will first receive some information about Participant B's responses in 
        Task 2.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have selected {{ Constants.reveal_statements|length }} of the statement 
        pairs from Task 2. Participant Bâ€™s choice from those 
        {{ Constants.reveal_statements|length }} pairs, together with the price 
        named for switching those statements, will be revealed to Participant A.
    </p>
