                        Thank you for participating in our research study.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will no doubt have noticed that several of the items in this research asked you to
                        respond to hypothetical questions about behavior which many people would regard as morally
                        objectionable. We realise that you may have felt confronted and distressed by these questions,
                        and we therefore wish to take this opportunity to explain why we find it necessary to use
                        these materials.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This study is not intended to measure how common or uncommon particular moral attitudes are. We
                        are not especially interested in whether or not you gave one answer or the other on a particular
                        item.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rather, we are interested how strong value commitments affect cooperative or bargaining
                        interactions. The key hypothesis is that individuals with strong moral commitments are
                        likely to be treated differently -- usually more favorably -- than people who lack strong
                        moral commitments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To test this hypothesis, we need to find a plausible way in the laboratory to distinguish
                        between people who do and do not have strong moral commitments. By giving participants the
                        opportunity to obtain significant amounts of money in exchange for signing a distasteful
                        statement, we get some measure of how strongly the moral commitment is held. People with a
                        very strong commitment to a statement will not accept any amount of money to accept the
                        opposite.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the primary population of individuals we are studying, strong commitments are relatively
                        rare: for most value statements we have tried, most participants will sign the opposite
                        statement, even for a small amount of money. To adequately test our hypothesis, therefore,
                        we need to ask about relatively extreme value commitments. That is why some of the statements
                        were so confronting -- because we were trying to make sure that every participant revealed
                        at least some strong moral commitments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We hope you understand our reasons, therefore, for using such confronting questions. We
                        certainly would not have done so if we thought we could address our hypothesis in a less
                        disturbing fashion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have any further questions or concerns about this research, we strongly encourage
                        you to get in touch with the lead researcher, Professor Toby Handfield.
